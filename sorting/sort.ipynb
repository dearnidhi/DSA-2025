    "## 🔶 What is Sorting?\n",
    "Sorting means arranging data in a particular order — either ascending (low to high) or descending (high to low).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Real-life Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel – Sorting columns of numbers or text A→Z or Z→A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon – Sorting products by price, rating, or reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photos sorted by height – Like arranging photo frames from shortest to tallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔶 Why Do We Need Multiple Sorting Algorithms?\n",
    "Because different algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Work better in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vary in speed, memory usage, and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose sorting based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "How much time is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much memory (space) we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the relative order of equal elements matters (stability).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔶 Classification of Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Based on Space Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## In-place Sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Does not use extra memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifies the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Out-of-place Sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses extra space to sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creates a copy or temporary arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example: Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Based on Stability\n",
    "## ✅ Stable Sorting:\n",
    "Keeps original order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "If two students have the same marks but appear in a specific order before sorting, a stable sort keeps that same order after sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Examples: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ Unstable Sorting:\n",
    "Can change the order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Example: Quick Sort, Selection Sort\n",

    "## 📌 What is Bubble Sort?\n",
    "Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm, also known as sinking sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔁 It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, until the list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",

    "Compare two adjacent elements.\n",

    "Continue for the entire list (this is called a pass).\n",
